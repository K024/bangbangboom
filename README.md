Recently we (actually myself only) have **NO** plan of setting up a new community aside from [Bestdori](https://bestdori.com) .

We detached the editor into a separate project serving at [bangbangboom editor](https://editor.bangbangboom.moe) , which now is able to export Bestdori map format directly.

You can try to play maps uploaded on bestdori at [BanGuround Player](https://player.banground.fun/) .
