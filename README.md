Recently we (actually myself only) have **NO** plan of setting up a new community aside from [Bestdori](https://bestdori.com) . Have a try with [Sonolus](https://sonolus.com/) developed by the Bestdori team for a better game experience.

We detached the editor into a separate project serving at [bangbangboom editor](https://bbb-editor.pages.dev) , ~~which now is able to export Bestdori map format directly~~ the map format is now incompatible after several updates.

~~You can try to play maps uploaded on bestdori at [BanGuround Player](https://player.banground.fun/) .~~
